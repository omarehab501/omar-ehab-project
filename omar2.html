   <paraghraph>C++ is a high-level object-oriented programming 
    language that helps programmers write fast, portable programs. C++ provides rich library 
    support in the form of Standard Template Library (STL).<br><br>
C++ Language Features:

Some of the interesting features of C++ are:<br>
    Object-oriented: C++ is an object-oriented programming language. This means that the focus is on “objects” and manipulations around these objects.
    Information about how these manipulations work is abstracted out from the consumer of the object.
    Rich library support: Through C++ Standard Template Library (STL) many functions are available that help in quickly writing code.
    For instance, there are standard libraries for various containers like sets, maps, hash tables, etc.
    Speed: C++ is the preferred choice when latency is a critical metric. The compilation, as well as the execution time of a C++ program, 
    is much faster than most other general purpose programming languages.
    Compiled: A C++ code has to be first compiled into low-level code and then executed,
    unlike interpreted programming languages where no compilation is needed.<br><br>
   
   
   
some of interesting about java: <br>  
   
 The initial name of java was “Oak”. It was changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department changed it
    to “java” when they found that name was already registeredfor some computer company.

Java was made by an accident. Around 1992, James Gosling was working at the Sun Labs.
    He and his team at that time were building a set-top box and which is started by
    “cleaning up” the C++ and they all wound up with a new language called Java or Oak.

Java is the second most popular language and is very popular among the developers.

Java is free from the concept of Pointer as adding pointers to Java language
    would compromise security and the robustness, making this language more complex.

In Java, The meaning of Final keyword is not final. It has different meanings in java.
    It can be Final class, Final method, Final field or Final variable.

Java is used by 95% of the enterprises as their primary language. 
    It is much more than C and the other languages.
In one year Java gets downloaded one billion times.  <br><br> 
   
   
some of interesting about python :
 
    Introduction to Python Python is one of the most popular programming languages that is used by programmers. 
    Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the year 1991.
    Python language facilitates the development of small and large scale dynamic websites.
    This language provides developers with easy code readability and enables lesser coding. 
    It is an object-oriented language used for development, scripting, and testing. 
    It facilitates developers with enhanced productivity as it requires developing fewer codes.
    The Python language is supported by extensive libraries offering memory management. 
    It also extends supports for easy debugging. Python is an extensively used language by many
    to organizations such as Dropbox, Quora, IBM, and CISCO. Taking an Online Python Training 
    Course is an effective way to learn Python programming.
